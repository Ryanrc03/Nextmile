git clone https://github.com/Ryanrc03/Nextmile.git
cd Nextmile
./scripts/deploy_to_new_server.sh --domain your-domain.com --email your-email@example.com
```

That's it! The script will automatically:

- ✅ Configure environment variables
- ✅ Build the project
- ✅ Set up Nginx and SSL certificates
- ✅ Start all services
- ✅ Verify the deployment

### Migration from Old Server

Migrating from an existing server? Follow these steps:

1. **Backup old server** (run on old server):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/backup_before_migration.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy to new server**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy_to_new_server.sh --domain your-domain.com --email your-email@example.com
   ```

3. **Migrate data** (run on new server):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/migrate_data.sh --from old-server-ip --ssh-key ~/.ssh/key.pem
